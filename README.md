# BTW21 Facebook and Instagram Accounts of Parties and Candidates

This repository includes a list of Facebook and Instagram accounts of candidates and parties that ran in the 2021 German federal election.

The list of accounts  was first collected as part of the project [MINE-GE: Mapping Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior in the Lead Up to the 2021 German Federal Election](https://www.medienanstalt-nrw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/NeueWebsite_0120/Zum_Nachlesen/BTW22_Political_Advertisement.PDF), funded by Landesanstalt für Medien Nordrhein Westfalen. The current list includes *accounts still active and included in CrowdTangle as of the release date (July 8, 2022)*. The number of counts can therefore be different from the original list used in the study.

The csv file includes four columns: Account, Codename, URL, and List.
