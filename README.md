# Facebook and Instagram Accounts of Parties and Candidates Running in the 2021 Germany's federal election

This repository includes a list of Facebook and Instagram accounts of candidates and parties running in the German federal election held on 26 September 2021 to elect the members of the 20th Bundestag.

A initial list of accounts was collected as part of the project [MINE-GE: Mapping Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior in the Lead Up to the 2021 German Federal Election](https://www.medienanstalt-nrw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/NeueWebsite_0120/Zum_Nachlesen/BTW22_Political_Advertisement.PDF), funded by Landesanstalt für Medien Nordrhein Westfalen. Starting from July 2021, we identified the Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter social media accounts of the seven main parties (AfD, CDU, CSU, DIE LINKE, FDP, DIE GRÜNEN, SPD) and their candidates, relying on the official websites of the parties and the lists of “Direktkandidaten” and “Listenkandidaten” published in the lead up to the elections.

The list shared in this repository (BTW21_FB_IG.csv) includes only the *accounts of the original list that are still active and included in CrowdTangle as of the release date, July 8, 2022*, for total of 2,828 accounts (1,317 Facebook accounts and 1,511 Instagram accounts).

The csv file includes four columns: Account, Codename, URL, and List.
